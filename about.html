        Their practice engages with both qualitative and quantitative methods in an effort to collapse the clear distinctions perceived between various subjects and objects. This has lead to solo and collaborative work in short films and music videos, presenting talks on subjects such as Noise, Rhythm, and Entropy, and contributing work to various group exhibitions and online publications.
        <br />
        <br />
        Working with drawing and panting, process and instructional work, programming, sculpture, composition and sound design, installation, robotics, video, animation and performance; Jakeâ€™s goal is ultimately to raise questions that encourage conversation between different disciplines allowing the formation of new ways of understanding and engaging with the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jake recently completed a Fine Art degree graduating First Class (Honours), and is currently undertaking various research projects with particular interest in genetic algorithms, chaos, semiotics, and cybernetics.
